# UnderArmour API

_note: new project, not yet published to ruby gems_

Ruby gem to utilize UnderArmour API

Includes the authorization flow, as well as simple methods to query and retrieve specific data for an authenticated user.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'underarmour_api'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install underarmour_api

## Usage

### Authentication

Request a `client_id` and `client_secret` for the Underarmour Api from their [developer site](https://developer.underarmour.com/docs/) under "Request a Key".
Once you store those values in a safe place, you can pass them through to the gem either in the config file, or by instantiating a client with those values manually:

**app/config/initializers/underaroumour_api.rb**
```ruby
  UnderarmourApi.config do |config|
    config.client_id = ENV['UA_CLIENT_ID']
    config.client_secret = ENV['UA_CLIENT_SECRET']
  end
```

or

`client = UnderarmourApi::Client.new(client_id: ENV['UA_CLIENT_ID'], client_secret: ENV['UA_CLIENT_SECRET'])`

[TODO: fetching the user's access token and passing that through]

### Users

You can fetch the authenticated user's data either by calling `client.user`, or passing the client into `UnderarmourApi::User.me(client)`.

The authenticated user then has associated resources such as `profile_photos` and `workouts`.

Some of these resources can be further filtered for instance:

```ruby
  user = client.user
  user.profile_photo(:small) # >> returns the url for the small profile photo

  start_date = (DateTime.new(2017, 5, 21, 0, 0, 0)).iso8601
  user.workouts(started_after: start_date, order_by: start_datetime) # >> returns workouts that match the filter criteria
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.
